👨🏻‍💻 This is a project I have done during awesome [Sean Allen's](https://github.com/SAllen0400) iOS Dev Job Interview Practice - Take Home Project [course](https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/take-home).

📱 While the project has been relatively simple app I have enjoyed it even as a quite experienced iOS developer. I was able to took my own path but still enjoyed following Sean's advice and ideas. 

🔗 Be sure to check the course - it is worth it :)
